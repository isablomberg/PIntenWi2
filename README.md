This repo contains the code of a jsPsych (https://www.jspsych.org/7.3/) experiment to run it locally without internet connection (folder: **jsPsych_experiment**). More information on the study can be found on OSF.

The folder **counterbalancing** contains the R / rmd files to create the counterbalancing structure of the experiment and matching *cheat sheets*. These can be printed for the experimenter conducting the study.

The folder **sample_size_simulation** contains the R script to run a power analysis for the study.
